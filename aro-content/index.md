During the event, Red Hat Cloud Services experts will guide you through the ARO architecture, and will answer your questions. Also, it’s your choice as you may follow the Operations or Developer track to get a feel for how ARO will work for your team and workloads.

**Who should attend:** This full-day, in-person workshop is ideal for developers, architects and operations engineers who need a flexible and proven platform to build, deploy and scale applications.

**What to expect:** During the workshop, we will take you through one of two content tracks to help you understand some of the concepts of deploying container-based applications on Azure Red Hat OpenShift and how to operate an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster. We will cover the following:

- Use Azure Arc for logging and monitoring of OpenShift and containerized applications

### Development track:

- Deploy an application that uses an Azure Managed Database
- Learn how to use OpenShift Service Mesh for application observability and tracing
- Make an application on OpenShift scalable and resistant to node failures and upgrades
